### Stochastic growth

The example we just studied in the previous section hopefully gave us
some intuition for how to work with these Langevin equations. Now we are
ready to apply these stochastic equations to our evolutionary context.
In particular our objective is to model the stochasticity of cellular
growth. At the cellular scale that we have been thinking about for
bacteria, what this means is that not all bacteria divide synchronously
at the exact same time. There is a distribution of cell-cycle length
that depends on things such as nutrient availability and temperature.
The result of this cell-to-cell variability in cell-cycle length is that
there is noise in the growth curves that must be accounted for. But how
large is this noise and what is its functional form? In other words,
what is the form of the $B(x, t)$ term in when thinking about how cells
grow?

When we learn about bacteria growth we are usually told the fact that
bacteria grow exponentially. This is a natural consequence of assuming
that all bacteria grow and divide at the same rate. So in the first
division we pass from 1 to 2 bacteria, then we go from 2 to 4 and so on.
This leads to an exponential growth of the population as described by .
