### Beanbag genetics and the Wright-Fisher model

As it has hopefully become clear so far in the book, we are not afraid to make
gross oversimplifications about the process we are trying to model. After all,
these simplifications and idealizations allow us to make analytical and
computational progress, distilling the relevant features of complex phenomena.
Thus, unapologetically, we will continue returning to "beanbag genetics" as a
way to study evolution. Arguably, the most important beanbag genetics model is
the so-called Wright-Fisher model, independently created by two field
pioneers---Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher. Ironically, the model carries both
names since Fisher and Wright disagreed and bitterly fought about almost every
topic in population genetics throughout their prolific careers.

The Wright-Fisher model assumes that a population of diploid organisms has a
fixed population size and non-overlapping generations. In other words, if at
generation $t$, there are $N$ organisms (therefore $2N$ alleles due to
diploidy), generation $t + 1$ will also have $N$ organisms. Still, none of the
ones from the previous generation will make it to the next one. Furthermore,
although sexual reproduction involves two different sexes---also known as mating
types---the model takes the beanbag genetics to the extreme. As schematized in
@fig-beanbag_genetics, new organisms are created by blindly grabbing one allele
from the bag, writing down its identity, and then putting it back in the bag to
repeat the process for the second allele. In other words, we sample both alleles
with replacement. This oversimplification allows us to write a simple
mathematical description of how the probability of having a particular allele
frequency in the population changes over time.

Thinking about the Buri experiment from the previous section, let us assume that
$N_\text{pop} = 16$ individuals conform each generation. We are interested in
tracking the allele frequency of the red-eye allele in the *bw* locus in the
population. To stick to our previous notation, we will define $A$ as the red-eye
allele and $a$ as the white-eye allele. At generation $t = 0$, when all flies
are heterozygote, there are $N_A^{(0)} = 16$ copies of allele $A$ and $N_a^{(0)}
= 2N_\text{pop} - N_A^{(0)} = 16$ copies of allele $a$ in the population. To
form generation $t = 1$ we draw $2N_\text{pop}$ alleles from this pool with
replacement as depicted in @fig-beanbag_genetics. Assume we draw an allele $A$
on the first trial. The probability of this is given by the fraction allele $A$
occupies in the population, i.e.,
$$
\text{Probability of drawing }A = \frac{N_A^{(0)}}{2N_\text{pop}}.
$${#eq-prob_draw_A}
Once we draw the first allele, we write it down and put it back in the beanbag.
Let us assume that the second draw is also allele $A$. Since these two events 
are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of the
probabilities of each occurrence [`cite Appendix on basic probability`], i.e.,
$$
\text{Probability of drawing two }A\text{s} = 
\left( \frac{N_A^{(0)}}{2N_\text{pop}} \right)^2.
$${#eq-prob_draw_two_A}


The probability of drawing
$N_A^{(1)}$ alleles in generation 1, where $N_A^{(1)}$ can be any number between
0 and $2N_\text{pop}$
