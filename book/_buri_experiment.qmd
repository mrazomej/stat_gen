### The Buri experiment

In 1956 Peter Buri, a student of Sewall Wright published the now classic
paper "*Gene Frequency in Small Populations of Mutant Drosophila*" in
which he experimentally demonstrated the concept of genetic drift. The
idea for this beautiful experiment is depicted in . Briefly, Buri began
with eight female and eight male flies, all heterozygotes of the *bw*
locus. This means that all of the flies had 1 copy of the gene
associated with white eyes, and one copy of the gene associated with red
eyes. The phenotype that this combination of alleles gives is flies with
orange eyes. He then allowed the flies to reproduce, and after removing
the adults, he randomly chose 8 males and females from the next
generation of offspring without looking at the eye color. These new 8
males and 8 females were transferred to a new flask and the procedure
was repeated for 19 generations.

![**Buri's experimental setup.** At time $t=0$ eight heterozygote
females and eight heterozygote males were allowed to reproduce. From
their offspring, eight males and eight females were chosen at random and
transferred into a new
flask.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_01_buri_schematic.png){#fig_buri_schematic}

Since the offspring that made it to the next generation were chosen at
random, Buri knew that the outcome would be different if he repeated an
identical experiment in different vials. As a result, for statistical
power he simultaneously tracked 107 flasks as shown in . Each
generation, he counted the number of red-eyed, white-eyed and
orange-eyed flies he had randomly chosen. shows the outcomes for these
different vials after 19 generations. Because the flies are allegedly
mating at random, with each generation there is an accumulation of
fluctuations. As a result, after 19 generations, many vials contained
only white-eyed or red-eyed flies, though some vials still contained a
mixture of eye colors.

![**Multiple replicates of the Buri experiment.** Buri repeated his
experiment in 107 separate vials, with the evolutionary trajectory
different each time as a result of genetic drift. Note that in the long
time limit, many of the vials have gone to fixation with all flies
having either white or red
eyes.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_02_buri_generations.png){#fig_buri_generations}

Having quantified the number of red-eyed, white-eyed and orange-eyed
flies Buri was able to quantify the frequency of alleles in the
population. Since none of the alleles were dominant, he could infer the
genotype by looking at the phenotype of the flies.

summarizes the results of the experiment. By tracking alleles over time
with these 107 populations exposed to the same conditions, Buri was able
to observe evolution driven entirely by genetic drift! He saw how in
some of the populations one of the alleles went extinct, arising from
nothing more than the fluctuations inherent in small populations.

![**Results of the Buri experiment.** By tracking the phenotypes of the
flies, Buri was able to infer the allele frequencies for each
population. The allele frequencies change as a result of genetic drift
and after 19 generations, many of the vials contain flies all with the
same eye color, implying fixation of alleles and evolution due to
genetic
drift.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_03_buri_experiment.png){#fig_buri_experiment}

Now that we have looked at an experimental evidence of genetic drift on
a laboratory experiment let's go back to the mathematical modeling of
this phenomena.
