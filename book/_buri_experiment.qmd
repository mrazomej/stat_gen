# Genetic drift and the stochastic nature of evolution

So far we have studied two of the forces of evolution from a
deterministic perspective. This sounds contradictory given the intuition
that biologists have about how the evolutionary process works. On the
one hand any biologist will tell you that evolution is a completely
random process; from the emergence of a beneficial mutation to the
process of fixing this mutation in the population, these dynamics are
hard if not impossible to predict.

On the other hand in a conflicting view of evolution, biologists tend to
associate every biological feature to a product of selection. Either by
natural or sexual selection, the literature is full of "just-so-stories"
that attribute a functional purpose to every aspect of biological
systems. Therefore the claim is that the process occurs at random, but
everything serves a purpose. The truth most likely lies somewhere in
between.

At the dawn of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory Sewall Wright
came to the conclusion that reproductive stochasticity could play an
important role in the fate of populations. In other words, not because a
beneficial mutation appeared in the population it would necessarily take
over the population; or not because a deleterious mutation appeared in
the population it would be immediately removed. Accidents in evolution
still play an important role when it comes to setting the fate of a
population. From a beneficial mutation being lost due to some
non-selection related event such as a stochastic death of the organism
carrying the mutation, to the fixation of deleterious mutations in the
population. The first experimental demonstration of this non-selection
based evolution came out of Wrights own academic lineage. His own
student, Peter Buri, designed the first experiment to demonstrate the
force of genetic drift.

## The Buri experiment

In 1956 Peter Buri, a student of Sewall Wright published the now classic
paper "*Gene Frequency in Small Populations of Mutant Drosophila*" in
which he experimentally demonstrated the concept of genetic drift. The
idea for this beautiful experiment is depicted in . Briefly, Buri began
with eight female and eight male flies, all heterozygotes of the *bw*
locus. This means that all of the flies had 1 copy of the gene
associated with white eyes, and one copy of the gene associated with red
eyes. The phenotype that this combination of alleles gives is flies with
orange eyes. He then allowed the flies to reproduce, and after removing
the adults, he randomly chose 8 males and females from the next
generation of offspring without looking at the eye color. These new 8
males and 8 females were transferred to a new flask and the procedure
was repeated for 19 generations.

![**Buri's experimental setup.** At time $t=0$ eight heterozygote
females and eight heterozygote males were allowed to reproduce. From
their offspring, eight males and eight females were chosen at random and
transferred into a new
flask.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_01_buri_schematic.png){#fig_buri_schematic}

Since the offspring that made it to the next generation were chosen at
random, Buri knew that the outcome would be different if he repeated an
identical experiment in different vials. As a result, for statistical
power he simultaneously tracked 107 flasks as shown in . Each
generation, he counted the number of red-eyed, white-eyed and
orange-eyed flies he had randomly chosen. shows the outcomes for these
different vials after 19 generations. Because the flies are allegedly
mating at random, with each generation there is an accumulation of
fluctuations. As a result, after 19 generations, many vials contained
only white-eyed or red-eyed flies, though some vials still contained a
mixture of eye colors.

![**Multiple replicates of the Buri experiment.** Buri repeated his
experiment in 107 separate vials, with the evolutionary trajectory
different each time as a result of genetic drift. Note that in the long
time limit, many of the vials have gone to fixation with all flies
having either white or red
eyes.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_02_buri_generations.png){#fig_buri_generations}

Having quantified the number of red-eyed, white-eyed and orange-eyed
flies Buri was able to quantify the frequency of alleles in the
population. Since none of the alleles were dominant, he could infer the
genotype by looking at the phenotype of the flies.

summarizes the results of the experiment. By tracking alleles over time
with these 107 populations exposed to the same conditions, Buri was able
to observe evolution driven entirely by genetic drift! He saw how in
some of the populations one of the alleles went extinct, arising from
nothing more than the fluctuations inherent in small populations.

![**Results of the Buri experiment.** By tracking the phenotypes of the
flies, Buri was able to infer the allele frequencies for each
population. The allele frequencies change as a result of genetic drift
and after 19 generations, many of the vials contain flies all with the
same eye color, implying fixation of alleles and evolution due to
genetic
drift.](../../fig/drift_langevin/02_01_03_buri_experiment.png){#fig_buri_experiment}

Now that we have looked at an experimental evidence of genetic drift on
a laboratory experiment let's go back to the mathematical modeling of
this phenomena.
