- I fixed all the references to the figures. Rather than putting the numbers of
the figures in the `\fref{}` command themselves, I will only use the name of
the figure. This is because modifying these references if the figure numbering
changes would be too tricky and not worth it. Better to identify figures by
their names.
- I planned a new structure for the book and sent it to people to get an
  initial gut reaction.
